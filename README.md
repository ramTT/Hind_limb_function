# Kinematical analysis of hind limb function

**Aim:** Investigate the improvement in hind limb function over time following spinal cord injury.   

**Study design:**  
*Experimental groups:* I) SCI, II) SCI+medium, III) SCI+syngeneic MSCs, IV) SCI+allogenic MSCs, V) SCI+mouse stromal vascular fraction (mSVF).  

*Time points:* Transplantation (if applicable) 24 h post SCI. Measurement of hind limbs at 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63 and 70 days post SCI. 

**Statistical analysis** 
* *Indexation:* Expression values were index to the average value at three days post SCI for each animal separately. Mean expression of inflammation was calculated for each animal and time point. Biological replicates were used for all statistical calculations.   

* *Assumptions:* Normality was evaluated using Shapiro Wilk's test. Homogenity of variances was evaluated using Fligner Killeen's test.   

* *Multiple group comparison:* One way ANOVA was used given that data was normally distributed and variances were equal. Given that data was or was not normally distributed but variances were not equal Kruskal Wallis H test was used instead.   

* Sensitivity was analyzed at steady state (> 49d) byt bootstrap resampling.
